 My Computer Science Assignment (year 1)
 ### This program is written from Java (CLI)
  
 ```completed```
 
 ## How could you make this even better
 #### > You can build this exact code with GUI libaries
 #### > I have used arrays to move and store data, you could use JSON
 #### > I didn't ask the user if the user wants to end the program or keep on using it, you could add that feature
 #### > the ```run``` boolean feels useless thats controlling the while loop because of the above reason
